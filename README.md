## Performer - Pytorch

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/performer-pytorch.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/performer-pytorch)

An implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14794">Performer</a>, a linear attention-based transformer variant with a **F**ast **A**ttention **V**ia positive **O**rthogonal **R**andom features approach (FAVOR+).

## Install

```bash
$ pip install performer-pytorch
```

## Usage

Performer Language Model

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from performer_pytorch import PerformerLM

model = PerformerLM(
    num_tokens = 512,
    max_seq_len = 20000,             # max sequence length
    dim = 512,                      # dimension
    depth = 12,                     # layers
    heads = 8,                      # heads
    causal = False,                 # auto-regressive or not
    nb_features = 256,              # number of random features, if not set, will default to (d * log(d)), where d is the dimension of each head
    generalized_attention = False,  # defaults to softmax approximation, but can be set to True for generalized attention
    kernel_fn = nn.ReLU(),          # the kernel function to be used, if generalized attention is turned on, defaults to Relu
    reversible = True,              # reversible layers, from Reformer paper
    ff_chunks = 10,                 # chunk feedforward layer, from Reformer paper
    use_scalenorm = False,          # use scale norm, from 'Transformers without Tears' paper
    use_rezero = False,             # use rezero, from 'Rezero is all you need' paper
    ff_glu = True,                  # use GLU variant for feedforward
    emb_dropout = 0.1,              # embedding dropout
    ff_dropout = 0.1,               # feedforward dropout
    attn_dropout = 0.1,             # post-attn dropout
    local_attn_heads = 4,           # 4 heads are local attention, 4 others are global performers
    local_window_size = 256         # window size of local attention
)

x = torch.randint(0, 512, (1, 20000))
mask = torch.ones_like(x).bool()

model(x, mask = mask) # (1, 2048, 20000)
```

Plain Performer, if you are working with say images or other modalities

```python
import torch
from performer_pytorch import Performer

model = Performer(
    dim = 512,
    depth = 1,
    heads = 8,
    causal = True
)

x = torch.randn(1, 2048, 512)
model(x) # (1, 2048, 512)
```

Standalone self-attention layer with linear complexity in respect to sequence length, for replacing trained full-attention transformer self-attention layers.

```python
import torch
from performer_pytorch import SelfAttention

attn = SelfAttention(
    dim = 512,
    heads = 8,
    causal = False,
).cuda()

x = torch.randn(1, 1024, 512).cuda()
attn(x) # (1, 1024, 512)
```

To minimize model surgery, you could also simply rewrite the code, so that the attention step is done by the `FastAttention` module, as follows.

```python
import torch
from performer_pytorch import FastAttention

# queries / keys / values with heads already split and transposed to first dimension
# 8 heads, dimension of head is 64, sequence length of 512
q = torch.randn(1, 8, 512, 64)
k = torch.randn(1, 8, 512, 64)
v = torch.randn(1, 8, 512, 64)

attn_fn = FastAttention(
    dim_heads = 64,
    nb_features = 256,
    causal = False
)

out = attn_fn(q, k, v) # (1, 8, 512, 64)
# now merge heads and combine outputs with Wo
```

## Advanced

At the end of training, if you wish to fix the projection matrices to get the model to output deterministically, you can invoke the following

```python
model.fix_projection_matrices_()
```

Now your model will have fixed projection matrices across all layers
